This is my final project for CUNY SPS MSDA 609.
I tried to create a model to predict wins and losses for road teams playing the 2nd game of a back to back.
While I was working, the project kept expanding.  
And since I was under time constraints I did not organize these files in any coherent way.

To follow along and see what I did to create the data set and test/train the model,
look at the file called execute_all.R.  This file lists all files I used.

The final project presentation is named nicholas_capofari_slides.html
